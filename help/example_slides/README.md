I use `xaringan` to create the slides. Check out `xaringan` [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).

To create the example slides, download the entire "example_slides" folder. Edit the .Rmd file and then push the "Knit" button to create the .html file. The .html file will render in RStudio. You can click on "Open in Browser" (top left) to see the slides in your default browser.

To add a slide to the example, add `---` to the bottom of the .Rmd file and follow it with a title `# Slide Title`. To customize/change the colors and fonts, read more about `xaringan`.
