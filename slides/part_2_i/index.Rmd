# Make your code as readable as possible

- No firm, binding rule for using (or not using) the pipe operator with **vectors**
  - General practice is to ask yourself: "which format is easiest to read?"
  - Depends on the number of functions  
  - Depends on whether you are pulling a variable of tibble that you are processing  
    - `pull() == $`  
- In our class, we will use the `tidyverse` grammar when working with vectors for consistency sake and ease of learning
  
```r
length(unique(airbnb$address))
airbnb$address %>% unique() %>% length()
airbnb %>% pull(address) %>% unique() %>% length()
```
