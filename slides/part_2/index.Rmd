# Before we get started

SAVE FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS HELD OVER FROM THE PREVIOUS CLASS

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(countdown)
library(kableExtra)
options(scipen=999)

opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)

# What we learned in the previous class

- Getting up and running in RStudio  
- Core R concepts  
  - Data types
  - Relationship between data and functions  
- How to import data  
- Regularly used data summary functions  
- Assignment operator
- Troubleshooting basics  

---

# What we'll learn today  

- A bit more about troubleshooting
- Chaining together functions with a pipe operator (`%>%`)
- Selecting variables  
- Creating variables  
- Updating values  
- Subsetting tibbles/data frames  
- Aggregation  

---

# Troubleshooting your R code

Make sure...

- You loaded your libraries
- Arguments in your functions are comma-separated
- Your functions have start and closing parentheses
- You have start and end quotation marks where relevant
- The variable type is correct to perform the function you call
  - For example you probably don't want to run `min()` on a character string
- Your assignment operator looks like this: `<-`

---

# Troubleshooting your R code

So, how then do you "make sure" your code is error-free?

- Run code line by line  
- Ensure the code finished running (`+`s vs. `>`s in the R console)
- Red "x" annotation beside line numbers (after saving your file)

# Troubleshooting exercise 

**Exercise 1 - 5 minutes**  

This code contains 6 mistakes. The code is supposed to create four new data object called `reviews`, `price`, `med_reviews` and `max_price` and report median number of reviews and highest cost/night for a Seattle Airbnb rental.    

- Correct 7 coding mistakes  
- Reference the previous slides for help  

--

```r
library(tidyverse)
        
airbnb <- read_csv('https://bit.ly/3oadz2L')

reviews <- airbnb$reviews
price <- airbnb$price

med_reviews <- median(reviews)
max_price <- max(price)

med_reviews
max_price
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0)
```

# Select, create, and rename variables

# <span style="color:#6DA34D">Select</span>, create, and rename variables 

- `select()` keeps the named variables from the dataset
- You can also remove variables from the dataset with `-`
- Let's keep it simple for now and not nest functions within `select()`  
  - Exception: `everything()`
- Use `'``'` for multi-word variables and variable names that begin with numbers

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
head(select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price), 3)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
head(select(select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price), -rating), 3)
```

# Make your code as readable as possible

- A whole course could be taught on code format
- **BOTTOM LINE (FOR OUR COURSE)**  
  - Use the `tidyverse` pipe operator (`%>%`) when working with tibbles/data frames

--

**Bad** 
```r
head(select(select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price), host_id, price, everything()), 3)
```

**Good** 
```r
airbnb %>%
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) %>% 
  select(host_id, price, everything()) %>% 
  head(3)
```

---

# Make your code as readable as possible

- Use the `tidyverse` pipe operator (`%>%`) when working with tibbles/data frames
  - Easier to read and troubleshoot  
  - Easier to comment (write end of line comments or above line comments)
  - Modular

```r
airbnb %>%
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) %>% 
  select(host_id, price, everything()) %>% 
  head(3)
```

---

# Make your code as readable as possible

- No firm, binding rule for using (or not using) the pipe operator with vectors
  - Ask yourself: "which format is easiest to read?"
  - Depends on the number of functions  
  - Depends on whether you are pulling a variable of tibble that you are processing  
    - `pull() == $`
  
```r
length(unique(airbnb$address))
airbnb$address %>% unique() %>% length()
airbnb %>% pull(address) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

# Select, <span style="color:#6DA34D">create</span>, and rename variables

`mutate()` creates variables
- Create multiple variables in one go
- Use functions you already learned within `mutate()`
  - `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`
  - `as.character()`, `as.factor()`, `as.numeric()`
- Use `ifelse()` within `mutate()`

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    cost_per_room = accommodates / price
    , mean_price = mean(price)
    ) 
```

# Select, <span style="color:#6DA34D">create</span>, and rename variables

- A little more on `ifelse()`  
  - A logical test with a true-or-false outcome
  - To make comparisons use: `==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `%in%`, `!`
  - Also can use: `is.numeric()`, `is.character()`, etc.

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}

ifelse(city_2 %in% california, 'yes', 'no')
ifelse(237 %in% 200:300, 'yes', 'no')

# Select, <span style="color:#6DA34D">create</span>, and rename variables 

<b>Exercise - 6 minutes</b>  
- With the `climate` dataset, create variables called `high_uncertainty` and `winter`
- In `high_uncertainty`, flag with a `1` all observations where `uncertainty` is greater than 1.5. All other records should have a `0`  
- In `winter`, flag with a `1` all observations where month is a 1, 2, 12.  
- Only report the following variables in the output: `country`, `city`, `high_uncertainty` and `winter`

climate <- read_csv('https://bit.ly/3kKErEb')
