# Before we get started

SAVE FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS HELD OVER FROM THE PREVIOUS CLASS

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(countdown)
library(kableExtra)
options(scipen=999)

# What we learned in the previous class

- Getting up and running in RStudio  
- Core R concepts  
  - Data types
  - Relationship between data and functions  
- How to import data  
- Regularly used data summary functions  
- Assignment operator
- Troubleshooting basics  

---

# What we'll learn today  

- A bit more about troubleshooting
- Chaining together functions with a pipe operator (`%>%`)
- Selecting, creating, and updating variables  
- Subsetting tibbles/data frames  
- Aggregation  

---

# Troubleshooting your R code

Make sure...

- You loaded your libraries
- Arguments in your functions are comma-separated
- Your functions have start and closing parentheses
- You have start and end quotation marks where relevant
- The variable type is correct to perform the function you call
  - For example you probably don't want to run `min()` on a character string
- Your assignment operator looks like this: `<-`

---

# Troubleshooting your R code

So, how then do you "make sure" your code is error-free?

- Run code line by line  

--
- Ensure the code finished running (`+`s vs. `>`s in the R console)  

--
- Red "x" annotation beside line numbers (after saving your file)

# Troubleshooting exercise 

**Exercise 1 - 5 minutes**  

This code contains 5 mistakes. The code is supposed to create four new data objects called `reviews`, `price`, `med_reviews` and `max_price` and report the median number of reviews and highest cost/night for a Seattle Airbnb rental.    

- Correct 5 coding mistakes  
- Reference the previous slides for help

```r
library(tidyverse
        
airbnb < read_csv('https://bit.ly/3oadz2L')

reviews <- airbnb$review
price <- airbnb$price

med_reviews <- median(reviews)
max_price <- MAX(price)

med_reviews
max.price
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0)

# <span style="color:#6DA34D">Select</span>, create, and rename variables 

- `select()` keeps the named variables from the dataset
- You can also remove variables from the dataset with `-`
- Let's keep it simple for now and not nest functions within `select()`  
  - Exception: `everything()`
- Use `'``'` for multi-word variables and variable names that begin with numbers

--

```r

# Make your code as readable as possible

- A whole course could be taught on code format
- **BOTTOM LINE (FOR OUR COURSE)**  
  - Use the `tidyverse` pipe operator (`%>%`) when working with tibbles/data frames

--

**Bad** 
```r
select(select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price), host_id, price, everything())
```

**Good** 
```r
airbnb %>%
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) %>% 
  select(host_id, price, everything())
```

---

# Make your code as readable as possible

- Use the `tidyverse` pipe operator (`%>%`) when working with tibbles/data frames
  - Easier to read and troubleshoot  
  - Easier to comment (write end of line comments or above line comments)
  - Modular

```r
airbnb %>%
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) %>% 
  select(host_id, price, everything()) 
```

---

# Make your code as readable as possible

- No firm, binding rule for using (or not using) the pipe operator with vectors
  - Ask yourself: "which format is easiest to read?"
  - Depends on the number of functions  
  - Depends on whether you are pulling a variable of tibble that you are processing  
    - `pull() == $`
  
```r
length(unique(airbnb$address))
airbnb$address %>% unique() %>% length()
airbnb %>% pull(address) %>% unique() %>% length()
```

# Select, create, and <span style="color:#6DA34D">rename</span> variables 

- `rename()` assigns a new name to an existing variable
- Renaming is possible with `transmute()` and `mutate()`as well
  - `rename()`: renames selected variables, keeps all other variables
  - `transmute()`: renames selected variables, drops all other variables
  - `mutate()`: creates new variables (with new names) and keeps originals
- Each variable transformation is comma-separated  

--

**Example**
- How do I rename `address` as `city`, `price` as `cost`, and `name` as `description` with one of the methods in `airbnb`?

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  rename(
    city = address
    , cost = price
    , description = name
    )

# Filter data frames

---

# Filter data frames

- Use `filter()` to subset your data
- With `filter()`, you tell R to exclude/include data that meet a logical TRUE/FALSE condition
- Operators for conditions are the same as for `ifelse()`: `==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `%in%`, `!`, `is.na()`

```r
airbnb %>% 
  filter(address != 'Seattle') %>% 
  select(room_id, host_id, address) %>% 
  tail(2)
```

---

# Filter data frames 
- You can stipulate multiple conditions with `filter()`
  - Use `&` for 'and' expressions
  - Use `|` for 'or' expressions
  - If there are two or more sets of conditions, wrap conditions in `()` or use more than one `filter()`

```r
airbnb %>% 
  filter(rating == 5 & room_type == 'Private room') %>% 
  select(room_id, host_id, address, room_type, rating, name) %>% 
  head(5)
```

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  filter(
    rating == 5
    & (
      (price < 50 & room_type == 'Private room')
      | (price > 50 & price < 100 & room_type == 'Entire home/apt')
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(room_id, host_id, address, room_type, price, name) %>% 
  head(5)
```

---

# Filter data frames
- Other functions for subsetting your data
  - `head()`
  - `tail()`
  - `sample_n()`
  
--

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
airbnb %>% sample_n(3) %>% select(room_id, host_id, address, room_type, price, name)
```

--

```{r, echo = TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
airbnb %>% sample_n(3) %>% select(room_id, host_id, address, room_type, price, name)

# Aggregate data with group_by() and summarise()

---

# group_by() and summarise() 

- Count, sum, average, and identify max and min values
- Example questions you could answer
  - In `airbnb`, on average which city is most costly per night?   
  - In `airbnb`, how many hosts offer each room type?
  - In `airbnb`, on average how many more people does an 'Entire home/apt' accommodate than a 'Private room'?  
  - In `climate`, what's the average temperature by year in cities in China?  
  - In `climate`, to what extent does the range of uncertainty vary over time?  

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

- In `group_by()`, list the variables by which you want to aggregate data
- In `summarise()`, create a variable and define the variable with an aggregation function
- Use `%>%` to 'link' `group_by()` and `summarise()`
- Aggregation functions
  - `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc.
- Perform multiple aggregations in a single `summarise()` function  

--

**Example**  
In `airbnb`, on average which city is most costly per night?   

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(address) %>% 
  summarise(mean_cost = mean(price))
```

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

**Example**  
In `airbnb`, how many hosts offer each room type?

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(room_type) %>% 
  summarise(n_hosts = n_distinct(host_id))
```

--

How do you update the code to count the number of hosts offering the three room types by city?

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(room_type, address) %>% 
  summarise(n_hosts = n_distinct(host_id))
```

--

How do you further update the code to only see rows for Kirkland?

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(room_type, address) %>% 
  summarise(n_hosts = n_distinct(host_id)) %>% 
  filter(address == 'Kirkland')
```

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

**Example**  
In `airbnb`, how many hosts offer each room type?

How do you further update the code to only see rows for Kirkland?

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(room_type, address) %>% 
  summarise(n_hosts = n_distinct(host_id)) %>% 
  filter(address == 'Kirkland')
```

--

How would you create a variable that flags a host deficit for types of rentals (let's say any number of hosts fewer than 100)?

--

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(room_type, address) %>% 
  summarise(n_hosts = n_distinct(host_id)) %>% 
  filter(address == 'Kirkland') %>% 
  mutate(host_deficit = ifelse(n_hosts < 100, 'y', 'n'))
```

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

**Exercise - 10 minutes**  
With `climate`, create a variable called `dif` that reports the difference between the smallest and largest uncertainty values for years after 1800. 
- What is the largest difference in uncertainty? 
- BONUS POINTS: In which year is the largest difference?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0)
```

--

**Hint**: To answer the bonus points question you need to use `max()` inside of `filter()`
