# What we learned in the previous class

- Getting up and running in RStudio  
- Core R concepts  
  - Data types
  - Relationship between data and functions  
- How to import data  
- Regularly used data summary functions  
- Assignment operator (`<-`)
- Basic troubleshooting

---

# What we'll learn today  

- Creating and updating variables  
- Subsetting tibbles/data frames  
- Aggregation  
- Reshaping (or pivoting) data

---

# Reminder on how to troubleshoot code

Make sure...

- You loaded your libraries
- Arguments in your functions are comma-separated
- Your functions have start and closing parentheses
- You have start and end quotation marks where relevant
- The variable type is correct to perform the function you call
  - For example you probably don't want to run `min()` on a character string
- Your assignment operator looks like this: `<-`
- You're running code inside a code chunk (in a notebook)

--

Also, feel free to ask ChatGPT why you see an error!

```
Why does this code throw an error in R? 
[Your code]

# Refresher with MBA admissions data

You can find the a description of the MBA admissions data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/mba-admission-dataset). The data were generated from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Class of 2025. Use functions to explore [tibbles](https://gbearden.github.io/r_course_evans_school/slides/part_1/#38) and [vectors](https://gbearden.github.io/r_course_evans_school/slides/part_1/#44) from the previous class to help answer these questions.

--

**Exercise 1 - 8 minutes**  
- What is the lowest `gpa` in the `mba` tibble?  
- What is the average number of years of work experience (`work_exp`)?  
- How many applicants are international students?  
- In how many rows in the tibble is Consulting the `work_industry` value?  

--

<b>Begin the exercise by importing the mba admissions data in R Studio</b>  
```r
mba <- read_csv("https://bit.ly/4evYpeW")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 8, seconds = 0)

# <span style="color:#6DA34D">Select</span>, create, and rename variables 

- `select()` keeps the named variables from the tibble
- You can remove variables from the tibble with `-`
- You may use [selection helpers](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html)
  - For example, `everything()`
- Use `'``'` for multi-word variables and variable names that begin with numbers

--

```r
select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price)

# Make your code as readable as possible

- A whole course could be taught on how to format code
- For our course, use the pipe operator (`|>`) when working with **tibbles/data frames**  

--

**Bad** 
```r
select(select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price), host_id, price, everything())
```

**Good** 
```r
airbnb |>
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) |> 
  select(host_id, price, everything()) 
```

**Use pipes if possible, but this is okay** 
```r
airbnb_2 <- select(airbnb, host_id, reviews, rating, price)
select(airbnb_2, host_id, price, everything()) 
```

---

# Make your code as readable as possible

- Use the pipe operator (`|>`) when working with **tibbles/data frames**  
  - Easier to read and troubleshoot  
  - Easier to comment (write end of line comments or above line comments)
  - Modular
  - Makes data management within your script easier  
  - Style-wise, pipes are the present and future
- Do not use the operator when you need to:  
  - Refer to a data object created at an intermediate step
  - Process more than 1 distinct data object

```r
airbnb |>
  select(host_id, reviews, rating, price) |> 
  select(host_id, price, everything())

- A little more on `if_else()`  
  - A logical test with a true-or-false outcome
  - To make comparisons use: `==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `%in%`, `!`, `is.na()`
     - `==` 1 to 1 equivalency test
     - `%in%` lets you search for equivalency over a string
  - Concatenate values with `c()`

# Select, create, and <span style="color:#6DA34D">rename</span> variables 

- `rename()` assigns a new name to an existing variable
- Renaming is possible with `transmute()` and `mutate()`as well
  - `rename()`: renames selected variables, keeps all other variables
  - `transmute()`: renames selected variables, drops all other variables
  - `mutate()`: creates new variables (with new names) and keeps originals
- Each variable transformation is comma-separated  

**Example**
- How do I rename `address` as `city`, `price` as `cost`, and `name` as `description` with one of the methods in `airbnb`?

--

```r
airbnb |> 
  rename(
    city = address,

# Filter tibbles

---

# Filter tibbles

- Use `filter()` to subset your data
- With `filter()`, you tell R to exclude/include rows that meet a logical TRUE/FALSE condition
- Operators for conditions are the same as for `if_else()`: `==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, `%in%`, `!`, `is.na()`

```r
airbnb |> 
  filter(address != 'Seattle') |> 
  select(room_id, host_id, address)
```

---

# Filter tibbles 
- You can stipulate multiple conditions with `filter()`
  - Use `&` for 'and' expressions
  - Use `|` for 'or' expressions
  - If there are two or more sets of conditions, wrap conditions in `()` or use more than one `filter()`

```r
airbnb |> 
  filter(price > 50 & price < 100 & room_type == 'Entire home/apt') |> 
  select(room_id, host_id, address, room_type, rating, name)
```

---

# Filter tibbles
- Other functions for subsetting your data
  - `head()`
  - `tail()`
  - `sample_n()`

# Aggregate data with group_by() and summarise()

---

# group_by() and summarise() 

- Count, sum, average, and identify max and min values  
- Powerful in combination with plotting code!  
- Example questions you could answer
  - In `airbnb`, on **average** which city is most costly per night?   
  - In `airbnb`, **how many** listings of each room type are there?
  - In `airbnb`, what's **the total** number of people to stay in each room type?  
  - In `climate`, what's the **average** temperature by year in cities in China?  
  - In `climate`, what's the **smallest** level of uncertainty by year and country?  

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

- In `group_by()`, list the variables by which you want to aggregate data
- In `summarise()`, create a variable and define the variable with an aggregation function
- Use `|>` to 'link' `group_by()` and `summarise()`
- Aggregation functions
  - `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, `min()`  
- Perform multiple aggregations in a single `summarise()` function  

--

**Example**  
In `airbnb`, on average which city is most costly per night?   

--

```r
airbnb |> 
  group_by(address) |> 
  summarise(mean_cost = mean(price))
```

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

**Example**  
In `airbnb`, how many listings of each room type are there?

--

```r
airbnb |> 
  group_by(room_type) |> 
  summarise(n_listings = n())
```

--

How do you update the code to count the number of room type listings by city?

--

```r
airbnb |> 
  group_by(room_type, address) |> 
  summarise(n_listings = n())
```

--

How do you further update the code to only see rows for Kirkland?

--

```r
airbnb |> 
  group_by(room_type, address) |> 
  summarise(n_listings = n()) |> 
  filter(address == 'Kirkland')
```

---

# group_by() and summarise()  

**Example**

```r
airbnb |> 
  group_by(room_type, address) |> 
  summarise(n_listings = n()) |> 
  filter(address == 'Kirkland')
```

Building on the code above, how would you create a variable that indicates whether there is a deficit of listings for the three `room_types` (let's say "deficit" is defined as fewer than 100 hosts)?

  - Columns into rows (with `pivot_longer()`), so the new tibble is narrower, has more rows, and fewer columns than the old tibble
  - Rows into columns (with `pivot_wider()`), so the new tibble is wider and has fewer rows than the old tibble

# Reshaping

`pivot_longer()`
- Turn columns into rows
- Often data are **easier to analyze** when stored in columns
- 4 arguments
  - `data`, Your tibble 
  - `cols`, which columns you want turn into rows
  - `names_to`, name of column for column names
  - `values_to`, name of column for values in columns
  
```r
airbnb %>% 
  select(room_id, host_id, room_type, address, reviews, rating) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(reviews, rating)
    , names_to = 'rental_characteristics'
    , values_to = 'values'
    )
  
```

# Reshaping

`pivot_wider()`
- Turn rows into columns
  - Good use of screen space
  - Data may be **easier to read** when denormalized (or are in a wider format)
  - Useful format when reporting + useful setting up calculations in specific situations
- 3 arguments
  - `data`, your tibble  
  - `names_from`, name of column that contains the names of the new columns
  - `values_from`, name of columns that contains the values of the new columns

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(address, room_type) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rentals = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = room_type, values_from = number_of_rentals)
```

```r
airbnb %>% 
  group_by(address, room_type) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_rentals = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = room_type, values_from = number_of_rentals) %>%
  mutate(private_or_shared = `Private room` + `Shared room`)
```

# Exercise - 10 minutes

With the `climate` data, report the mean temperatures for `"Angola"`, `"Ivory Coast"`, `"Ethiopia"`
, and `"Kenya"` in the years `1850`, `1900`, `1950`, and `2000`
- There should be one row per country
- You should pivot the data so the years are columns like in the example 
- In this exercise you will use `filter()`, `group_by()`, `summarise()`, and `pivot_wider()`

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 0)
