# Quick Tour of R Studio

- Script vs. notebook  
  - Scripts are good for code development, running code in production, version control, and multi-file analyses
  - Notebooks are good for sharing analysis, documentation, mixed code in a single file
- Run code from the notebook and the console  
  - Console vs. notebooks/scripts
- Make sure you can install packages
  - Command line/Console
  - R Studio GUI

--

```r
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

- Knowing data types when programming is really important!
  - Creates a set of rules for what operations can be executed  
- Data types  
  - Vectors, data frames, tibbles
      - `str_subset()` removes a value from a string
      - `filter()` removes an observation from a data frame or tibble
  - Vectors
      - Integers, numbers, characters, factors
      - You can sum integers and numbers, but not character strings

**More on data types**

- Inspect the dataset  
  - `class()` tells the overall type  
  - `is.[type]()` checks if something is numeric, character, etc.  
- Access parts of a dataset  
  - `$` to pull a column as a vector  
  - `[ ]` to pull elements by position  
- Create and coerce variables  
  - `as.character()`, `as.numeric()`  

**Import and inspect your own dataset (`read_csv()`)**  

```r
byod_df <- read_csv("[...].csv")
# Or take a look at the 538 partisan lean dataset from 2022
# https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/partisan-lean
byod_df <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/48Ru0Ip")

# Let's apply what we learned to real data

You are an analyst at the City of Seattle. City leadership wants to develop new policy to regulate Airbnb properties. Over the next month, you will be asked to prepare findings that you observe in the [dataset compiled on Airbnb properties](https://www.kaggle.com/shanelev/seattle-airbnb-listings).  

--

**Exercise - 5 minutes**  
- What type of data object is `airbnb`?  
- What is the fewest number of `reviews` for a property?  
- What is the average number of `reviews` for a property?  
- What is the range of number of `bathrooms` in the `airbnb` data?  

--

To answer the questions, import the Seattle `airbnb` dataset.  
```r
airbnb <- read_csv('https://bit.ly/3oadz2L')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0)

# Base R functions to explore tibbles

# Base R functions to explore tibbles 

Get in the habit of running these functions when you open a new dataset

- `head()` shows you the top of a tibble (or data frame)
  - `head()` argument defaults to 6  
  - `tail()` shows the bottom of a tibble  
  - `arrange()` pairs nicely with subsetting functions to explore your data
- `summary()` shows summary statistics on all variables in a dataset
  - Reported summary statistics depend on the variable type
  - Min, max, mean, and median are reported for numeric variables 
- `ls()` shows all variables in a tibble
  - You can also use `ls()` without calling an object between the parentheses to see all objects in your workspace
- `str()` tells the variable type and selected variable values in a tibble for all variables
- `dim()` tells you the dimensions of your dataset
  - `nrow()` reports the number of rows only 
  - `ncol()` reports the number of columns only

---

# Base R functions to explore tibbles

**Exercise 2 - 5 minutes**  
- How many observations (or rows) are in `airbnb`?  
- What is the median value for `rating`?  
- How many variables are in `airbnb`?  

<i>Hint: There are multiple ways to answers these questions with the functions you know</i>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0)
```

Other methods to answer questions
```r
dim(airbnb)

```

# Base R functions to explore vectors

- `table()` shows you the distribution of values in a vector  
  - Indexed by name and position  
- `length()` tells you in the number of elements in a vector  
- `unique()` shows you the unique values in a vector  
- `sort()` orders values in a vector  
- `summary()` shows you descriptive statistics on a vector  
  - `summary()` can run on a vector or tibble  

--

You can nest multiple functions
```r
length(unique(starwars$homeworld))
```

# Base R functions to explore vectors

**Exercise 3 - 5 minutes**  
- How many distinct `address` values are there?  
- Which is the third `host_id` value after sorting unique ids alphabetically?  
- Is 'yurt' a `room_type` value?  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
countdown(minutes = 5, seconds = 0)
```

# Troubleshooting your R code

Make sure...

- You loaded your libraries
- Arguments in your functions are comma-separated
- Your functions have start and closing parentheses
- You have start and end quotation marks where relevant
- The variable type is correct to perform the function you call
  - For example you probably don't want to run `min()` on a character string
- Your assignment operator looks like this: `<-`
- You're running code inside a code chunk (in a notebook)
