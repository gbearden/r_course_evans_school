Time: 6:00-8:50pm

## Overview

This is an introductory course that will avail R functionality in a way that is accessible to new R programmers. You will learn the fundamental skills required to prepare, analyze and report data in R. 

Course materials are prepared in order to offer a survey of selected R functionality. Students interested in R programming that is more sophisticated and/or specialized than what is taught in the course are encouraged to seek additional opportunities to apply their R programming skills.

This is an applied course that focuses on successful execution of code. While students should consider theory, style, and efficiency of R programming, getting the job done right will be the first priority.

## Course Expectations

- Attend four classes. Class dates are 10/14, 10/21, 10/28, & 11/4. A full class is 2 hours and 50 minutes, breaks included.
- Submit 2 "client ready" data visualizations.
  - Due on November 11 or before
 
## Accomodations

Washington State law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UWâ€™s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request Form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/). 

Please let me know if you need any specific accomodations related to religious observation or otherwise. I will help provide accomodations in accordance with Evans School policy and Washington State law.

## Schedule

#### October 8 | [Part 1](https://rpubs.com/gbearden/r_basics_aut20)

Part 1 will focus on the basics of R. Students will learn about key R concepts like data types and the anatomy of a function, how to read (import) and write (export) data, and the essentials of writing successful code.

We will also begin to explore the `tidyverse` as a data processing tool and troubleshooting tactics that students can use to solve coding errors.

At the end of Part 1, students should be familiar with the R interface, know how to perform basic operations, and walk through a series of steps to troubleshoot code.

Course materials: [Base R cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf), [Data transformation cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

#### October 15 | [Part 2](https://rpubs.com/gbearden/r_tidyverse_aut20)

Part 2 will focus on data processing. We will use a variety of methods to manipulate data and prepare it for analysis. The `tidyverse` will be emphasized. Students will learn how to manipulate data at various levels, including at the dataset-level, the variable-level, and the value-level.

At the end of Part 2, students should be able to transform datasets of varying levels of complexities into data suitable for analysis.

#### October 22 | [Part 3](https://rpubs.com/gbearden/r_dataviz_aut20)

Part 3 will focus on data visualization. We will use `ggplot`, a visualization library that is part of the `tidyverse`, to build a variety of charts. The modularity of `ggplot` charting functions will be emphasized as will the distinction between visualizing aggregated and non-aggregated data.

At the end of Part 3, students should be able to produce a standard set of charts and manipulate chart aesthetics.

Class reference materials: [Data visualization cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), [R for Stata folks](https://johnricco.github.io/2016/06/14/stata-dplyr/)


#### October 29 | [Part 4](https://rpubs.com/gbearden/r_reporting_aut20)

Part 4 will focus on reporting analyses with `officer`, a library that makes it easy to create PowerPoint decks. `officer` integration allows you to 'pipe into' PowerPoint analyses calculated in R in the form of text, tables, and charts. 

At the end of Part 4, students should be able to build PowerPoint decks that include R-generated analyses.

Class reference materials: [officer PowerPoint vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/officer/vignettes/powerpoint.html), [Evans School PowerPoint Template](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/raw/master/evans_school_template.pptx)

## Data

We will use the datasets below in our workshop. ([Here](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/process_course_data.r) is code to prepare the Covid-19 and Seattle crime data.)

* [Covid-19 Estimates Source](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/data-downloads)

* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). This is where you come when you get stuck. Google the problem you are having and you'll see a possible solution on the stackoverflow site. Guaranteed.
* [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). Your code can get really messy really quickly. This guide can help.

* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I love this site. It is great inspiration when building charts.
* [Top 50 ggplot2 Visualizations](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html). Check this out when you want to produce new chart types. It is full of good ideas.
* [Github](https://github.com/). If you're serious about any sort of programming, you should create a Github account.
