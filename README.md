## Overview

This workshop teaches the fundamental skills required to prepare, analyze and report data in R. This is an introductory course that will avail R functionality in a way that is accessible to new R programmers. 

Course materials are prepared in order to offer a survey of selected R functionality. Students interested in R programming that is more sophisticated and/or specialized than what is taught in the workshop are encouraged to seek additional opportunities to apply their R programming skills.

This is an applied course that focuses on successful execution of code. While students should consider theory, style, and efficiency of R programming, getting the job done right will be the first priority of the workshop.

## Course Expectations

- Attend four classes. Class dates are October 5, 12, 19, and 26. A full class is 2 hours and 50 minutes, breaks included.
- Submit a 2 slide PowerPoint deck generated in R that includes bullet points, at least one table, and at least one chart produced with the ggplot library
  - Due by October 28
  - Do not print code in output (echo = FALSE)
 
## Accomodations

Washington state law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UWâ€™s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at Religious Accommodations Policy (https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the Religious Accommodations Request form (https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/). 

Please let me know if you need any specific accomodations related to religious observation or otherwise. I will help provide accomodations in accordance with Evans School policy and Washington state law.

## Schedule

#### October 5 | [Part 1](http://rpubs.com/gbearden/r_basics_aut19)

Part 1 will focus on the basics of R. Students will learn about key R concepts like data types and the anatomy of a function, how to read (import) and write (export) data, and the essentials of writing successful code.

We will also begin to explore the `tidyverse` as a data processing tool and troubleshooting tactics students can use to solve coding errors.

At the end of Part 1, students should be familiar with the R interface, know how to perform basic operations, and walk through a series of steps to troubleshoot code.

Course materials: [Base R cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/base-r.pdf), [Data transformation cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf)

#### October 12 | Part 2

Part 2 will focus on data processing. We will use a variety of methods to manipulate data and prepare it for analysis. The `tidyverse` will be emphasized. Students will learn how to manipulate data at various levels, including at the dataset-level, the variable-level, and the value-level.

At the end of Part 2, students should be able to transform datasets of varying levels of complexities into data suitable for analysis.

#### October 19 | Part 3 

Part 3 will focus on data visualization. We will use `ggplot`, a visualization library that is part of the `tidyverse`, to build a variety of charts. The modularity of `ggplot` charting functions will be emphasized as will the distinction between visualizing aggregated and non-aggregated data.

At the end of Part 3, students should be able to produce a standard set of charts and manipulate chart aesthetics.

#### October 26 | Part 4

Part 4 will focus on reporting analyses with `officer`, a library that makes it easy to create PowerPoint decks. `officer` integration allows you to 'pipe into' PowerPoint analyses calculated in R in the form of text, tables, and charts. 

At the end of Part 4, students should be able to build PowerPoint decks that include R-generated analyses.

Class reference materials: [officer PowerPoint vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/officer/vignettes/powerpoint.html), [Evans School PowerPoint Template](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/evans_school_template.pptx)

## Data

We will use the datasets below in our workshop. These datasets are also used in the Computational Thinking for Governance Analytics course. ([Here](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/process_course_data.r) is code to prepare the political contributions and Seattle crime data.)

* [Contributions to Candidates and Political Committees](https://data.wa.gov/Politics/Contributions-to-Candidates-and-Political-Committe/kv7h-kjye)
  * [Political Contributions Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/master/data/contributions_data.txt)
* [Seattle Police Department 911 Incident Response](https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Data/4fs7-3vj5)
  * [Seattle Crime Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/master/data/crime_data.txt)

## R Download

If you have not downloaded R and R Studio already, use the links below to set up your machines.

* Install R ([on a Mac](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.6.1.pkg) and [on a PC](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.6.1-win.exe))
