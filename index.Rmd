## Schedule Overview

**Time: 5:30-8:20pm**  
**Class Dates: 10/3, 10/10, 10/17, 10/24**  
**Location: [PAR 220](https://www.washington.edu/maps/#!/par)** 

## Course Overview

This is an introductory course designed for new R programmers. You will learn the fundamental skills required to prepare, analyze and visualize data in R. You will also build a foundation for additional training in R and general applied data analysis.

Course materials are prepared in order to offer a survey of selected R functionality. Students interested in R programming that is more sophisticated and/or specialized than what is taught in the course are encouraged to seek additional opportunities to apply their R programming skills.

This is an applied course that focuses on successful execution of code. While students should consider theory, style, and efficiency of R programming, getting the job done right will be the first priority. Often ChatGPT is a helpful tool that aids in writing R code, so we'll use it on occasion in the course. 

## Course Expectations

- Attend four classes. Class dates are 10/3, 10/10, 10/17, 10/24. A full class is 2 hours and 50 minutes, breaks included.
- Submit 2 "stakeholder-ready" data visualizations by October 27 or before (See [example plots](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/plots/))
 
## Accomodations

Washington State law requires that UW develop a policy for accommodation of student absences or significant hardship due to reasons of faith or conscience, or for organized religious activities. The UWâ€™s policy, including more information about how to request an accommodation, is available at [Religious Accommodations Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/). Accommodations must be requested within the first two weeks of this course using the [Religious Accommodations Request Form](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/). 

Please let me know if you need any specific accommodations related to religious observation or otherwise. I will help provide accommodations in accordance with Evans School policy and Washington State law.

## Schedule

#### [October 3](https://gbearden.github.io/r_course_evans_school/slides/part_1/)

The first class will focus on the basics of R. Students will learn about key R concepts like data types and the anatomy of a function, how to read (import) and write (export) data, and the essentials of writing successful code.

We will also begin to explore data summary techniques and troubleshooting tactics that students can use to solve coding errors. 

At the end of first class, students should be familiar with the R interface, know how to perform basic operations, calculate summary statistics, and walk through a series of steps to troubleshoot code.

Helpful materials: [class notes](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/notes/part_1.Rmd), [example .R file](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/notes/example_script.R), [base R cheat sheet](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf)

#### October 10

The second class will focus on data processing. We will use a variety of methods to manipulate data and prepare it for analysis. The `tidyverse` will be emphasized. Students will learn how to manipulate data at various levels, including at the dataset-level, the variable-level, and the value-level.

At the end of second class, students should possess skills necessary to transform datasets so that data are suitable for analysis.

Helpful materials: [class notes](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/notes/part_1.Rmd), [data transformation cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-transformation.pdf), [data tidying cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/tidyr.pdf), [R for Stata users](https://www.matthieugomez.com/statar/manipulate-data.html)

#### October 17

The third class will focus on data visualization. We will use `ggplot`, a visualization library that is part of the `tidyverse`, to build many plot types. The modularity of `ggplot` plotting functions will be emphasized as will the distinction between visualizing aggregated and non-aggregated data.

At the end of third class, students should be able to produce a standard set of plots and manipulate plot aesthetics.

Helpful materials: [data visualization cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf), [Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

#### October 24

The fourth class will build on the skills students learned in previous lessons, introducing additional data visualization and data processing skills used to better work with strings and reshape data. 

At the end of the fourth class, students should be able to prepare data for analysis and "stakeholder-ready" visualization using a broad set of coding skills.

## Data

We will use the datasets below in our workshop. ([Here](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/data/process_course_data.r) is code to prepare the temperature and Airbnb data.)

* [Global Temperatures Source](https://www.kaggle.com/sohelranaccselab/global-climate-change)
  * [Global Temperatures Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/master/data/global_temperatures.csv)
* [Seattle Airbnb Source](https://www.kaggle.com/shanelev/seattle-airbnb-listings)  
  * [Seattle Airbnb Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/master/data/seattle_airbnb.csv)

## R Download

If you have not downloaded R and RStudio already, use the links below to set up your machines.

## Reference Materials

R community members produce valuable content to help you learn how to program in R. Here are some of my favorite resources that you might find useful as a new R programmer:

* [RStudio](https://posit.co/). The R IDE (integrated development environment) we will use in the course.
* [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/). The launch page for tidyverse.
* [Cheat sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/) (often these are available in other languages in case that's useful)
    + [Base R](https://iqss.github.io/dss-workshops/R/Rintro/base-r-cheat-sheet.pdf). This is useful to get started.
    + [Data transformation](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-transformation.pdf). I use this all the time when working with dplyr.
    + [Data tidying](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/tidyr.pdf). If the dplyr cheat sheet were Batman, the tidyr cheat sheet is Robin.
    + [Data visualization](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf). A great quick-reference for the ggplot library.
    + [R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/rmarkdown.pdf). A useful reference for using R Markdown.
    + [Lubridate](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/lubridate.pdf). Dates in R are a pain in the butt. This cheat sheet and the lubridate library will make your life easier.  
* [Karl Broman on data organization](http://kbroman.org/dataorg/). Prepare your data according to Karl's recommendations and R will become a lot easier. (The tip is relevant to all other KB recommendations.)
* [Jose Manuel Magallanes on data collection and organization](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Science-Social-Policy-Research/dp/1107540259/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1504135785&sr=8-1&keywords=jose+manuel+magallanes). Jose teaches the Computational Thinking for Governance Analytics course at the Evans School. He published this book a few years ago.
* [R Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/). All things R. Folks from various industries - many of whom are super smart with impressive R experience - share tips, tricks, and anecdotes here.
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r). This is where you come when you get stuck. Google the problem you are having and you'll see a possible solution on the stackoverflow site. Guaranteed.
* [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). Your code can get really messy really quickly. This guide can help.
* [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). I love this site. It is great inspiration when building plots.
* [Github](https://github.com/). If you're serious about any sort of programming, you should create a Github account.
* [RStudio Cloud setup](https://github.com/gbearden/r_course_evans_school/blob/master/rcloud_setup.md)
